# CDAC_SpMV_Project
This reposirtory contains programs and documentation of comparison study of SpMV multiplication.

Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) is one of the most important compu-
tational kernels in various computational intensive areas. SpMV is the multiplication of
sparse matrix A with vector x given by Ax = b. Here we have performed a compari-
son study between (I) naive approach, (II) Intel oneAPI library calls and (III) CUDA
enabled NVIDIA libraries. The study was carried out on matrices with single and dou-
ble prescision random numbers with increasing matrix sizes. Compressed Sparse Row
(CSR) format was used for sparse matrix storage. We found that on CPU side Intel
MKLâ€™s SpMV library calls gives best performance. On GPU side slight difference is ob-
served. CSR kernel and cuSPARSE shows similar performance on both single and double
precision.
